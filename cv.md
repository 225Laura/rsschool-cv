## *About me*
If I am passionate about something, I give myself to it completely.  
Since childhood I was engaged in music and after a long way I entered the Academy of Music. But in order to improve my skills I looked for and found opportunities to go abroad for master classes. I have visited dozens of countries and seen some of the best conductors in the world.  
Yes, I did not become a musician, but music is always with me and with the help of music I found my husband.   
Then I became interested in foreign languages.  
I went to the Linguistic University and graduated successfully. During my studies I realized that I needed to teach other people. So I organized classes with children and adults. I worked both with groups and individually. And it was a lot of fun!  
That's my approach to everything I'm starting to do seriously. Now I'm studying programming and I want to join a better company.
