            <p class="about-me-description">If I am passionate about something, I give myself to it completely.
            Since childhood I was engaged in music and after a long way I entered the Academy of Music. But in order to improve my
            skills I looked for and found opportunities to go abroad for master classes. I have visited dozens of countries and seen
            some of the best conductors in the world.
            Yes, I did not become a musician, but music is always with me and with the help of music I found my husband.
            Then I became interested in foreign languages.
            I went to the Linguistic University and graduated successfully. During my studies I realized that I needed to teach
            other people. So I organized classes with children and adults. I worked both with groups and individually. And it was a
            lot of fun!
            That's my approach to everything I'm starting to do seriously. Now I'm studying programming and I want to join a better
            company.</p>
